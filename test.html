        <p class="p_txt">This page was mainly made to test the Hot Corner Plugin (
            <strong>

            </strong>)
            <br/>The plugin itself does one thing : cover your webpage with a fully customizable
            curtain.
            <br/>It is so simple, concept and usage wise, that it opens the door to many
            applications - by embroidery of widgets to the curtain

    <h3>Motivation:</h3>
    <center>
        <p class="p_txt">I wanted to be able to access cool tools while navigating a page.</p>

    <h3>Example(s):</h3>
    <p class="p_txt">For this test, a simple Speed Reader widget was embroidered on the curtain <br/>
    All you have to do is <b> select  something </b> to be read( hey look it just happens that there is a text below ^^ from Wikipedia  )<br/>
    ,<b>  go on HC</b>  (top-left corner) and <b> click Start Reading</b> . To exit the curtain click anywhere below the line  </p>

            <p>Mimi first appears in the game Super Paper Mario during the meeting of
                Count Bleck's minions which occurs after Mario enters the door to Chapter
                1. However, Mimi's name and her actual form is not seen in this cutscene,
                as she uses her transformative abilities to appear like various different
                characters. She first takes upon O'Chunks's form, and, due to this being
                the introduction to the villains, seems like she really is the bulky minion,
                until the real O'Chunks pops in. Then, she takes upon Count Bleck's form
                to scold O'Chunks, Princess Peach's form to accept the Count's compliment
                on her shape-shifting, then Bowser's form to yell at Dimentio for reading
                her diary (a reference to the first Paper Mario). Mimi dresses in a maid
                uniform. Mario and Peach first encounter Mimi in her normal form when they
                reach Merlee's Mansion in Chapter 2-2. Unbeknown to the heroes, Mimi had
                been sent there by Count Bleck to defeat them before they can obtain the
                next Pure Heart, which Merlee has taken with her into hiding. Taking the
                guise of Merlee's handmaid, Mimi makes her first attempt on Mario and Peach's
                lives when she tells them that Merlee is in the room above them. When the
                heroes enter the room, the door is covered by bars and the roof begins
                to lower. Mario escapes the trap by flipping into 3-D, and continues his
                search for Merlee, He and Peach eventually release Merlee's pet, Gnaw,
                which chases Mimi away. In Chapter 2-3, Mimi orders Mario and Peach to
                work off a debt of one million Rubees after they break a vase. Using their
                new Pixl friend, Slim, they discover a secret stash of Rubees, allowing
                them to pay off the debt. This causes Mimi to go into a shock, saying it
                was "impossible" to earn one million Rubees and claiming the "wonderful
                curse" she put on the mansion was broken. She then flees by appearing to
                explode. Mimi yelling at Mario for breaking a vase. In the last part of
                Chapter 2, Mimi impersonates Merlee and asks Mario to sign a contract to
                pay off 10 million Rubees for the Pure Heart. However, a ghost-form of
                the real Merlee warns the heroes that it was a fake. Mimi gets angry and
                morphs into her Rubee-shooting "true" spider form, which is impervious
                to attacks at this point. She chases Mario and Peach around the mansion's
                basement, spawning at their location whenever they take too long to move
                on from a room. After a long and grueling chase, Mario and Peach find a
                bathroom at the bottom of the basement where Merlee is hiding with the
                Pure Heart. Mimi then appears and in a flash of light she transforms into
                Merlee. To decide which Merlee is the real one, a contest is held where
                Mario must ask each of the Merlee five questions to decide which one in
                the real Merlee. Regardless of whether or not the heroes choose correctly,
                Mimi attacks Mario and Peach, but Merlee removes her invincibility with
                cheer-leader-like chants. It is noted that Spider Mimi's legs fall off
                after taking enough hits. She is then defeated by Mario and flees the mansion.
                Mimi is fought again in Chapter 6. Posing as King Sammer, she tells Mario
                that the Pure Heart is in the chest beside them. When opening the Treasure
                Chest, Mario finds a bomb, and, when he isn't fazed by the explosion that
                erupts from it, Mimi attacks him, this time in her girl form, to waste
                the rapidly declining time before Sammer's Kingdom is destroyed by The
                Void. Although she loses in the battle, she succeeds in her goal as Sammer's
                Kingdom is destroyed. In Chapter 8, Mimi poses as Merlon and tells the
                heroes to hit a ! Block. When struck, it causes Mario and Co. to fall into
                a pit. She then disguises herself as Merlee once again, and asks three
                questions on what Mario is afraid of; she places the items or enemies in
                a corridor up ahead, and when the heroes survive, she gets upset and insults
                Peach. While Mario and Luigi continue on through the castle, Peach and
                Mimi have a one-on-one battle, ending in Mimi's defeat just as the room
                begins to fall apart. Mimi almost falls into a hole in the ground, and
                even though Peach grabs her by the leg in an attempt to save her, the girl
                is too heavy for the princess and they both fall into the trench. Mimi
                is revealed to survive when she and O'Chunks come to Count Bleck's aid
                after her fellow henchman, Dimentio, takes over. She warps herself and
                O'Chunks to Dimension D to help the Count. Mimi and O'Chunks' love for
                Count Bleck helped Mario, Peach, and Bowser defeat Super Dimentio. This
                action redeems Mimi. After the game is beaten, she gets a job working as
                Merlee's actual maid, and, since Merlee rarely uses her mansion (as she
                had moved to Flopside far earlier in the game), she decided turn Merlee's
                mansion into a stable of cutie-pies (boys). One of Mimi's former slaves
                says Mimi is making him pay for the time he spent in the mansion while
                she was away, he however is delighted at this because he now has something
                to do. To help raise money for her stable, she begins the creation of a
                Cutie-Pie Video Game and a Cutie-Pie Cafe.</p>
