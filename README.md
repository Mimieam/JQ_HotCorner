#This is a linux like Hot corner 

#Description
    when hovering on a 'hot corner' - it deploys a curtain covering the entire webpage


#Basic Behavior:
       On Hovering the HotCorner (HC) -  a large transparent curtain is deployed, expanding from the HC to the side of the browser.
       the curtain stays open until an click is inside of it is made.
	  
#Possible Customization:       
       persistent curtain - when persistantMode is On , anyclick on an element in the curtain does not close the curtain
       

#TO DO : 
         - add more example of possible usage.
            
            
            
            
ps : do not set persitent mode while add an child object that is covering the all curtain, or you wont be able to make it go away
