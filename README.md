#This is a linux like Hot corner - when u hover on a 'hot corner' - it deploys a div covering the entire webpage
#
#
# Basic Behavior:
#       On Hovering the HotCorner (HC) -  a large transparent curtain is deployed, expanding from the HC to the side of the browser.
#       the curtain stays open until an click is inside of it is made.
#	  
#   Possible Customization:       
#       persistent curtain - when persistantMode is On , anyclick on an element in the curtain does not close the curtain
#       
#
#  TO DO : 
#         - add more example of possible usage.
